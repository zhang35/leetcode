# Testcase Example:  '[[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]'
#
# Given a m x n grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top
# left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.
# 
# Note: You can only move either down or right at any point in time.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
# Output: 12
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# m == grid.length
# n == grid[i].length
# 1 <= m, n <= 200
# 0 <= grid[i][j] <= 200
#

                    continue
                if i == 0:
                    grid[i][j] += grid[i][j-1]
                elif j == 0:
                    grid[i][j] += grid[i-1][j]
                else:
                    grid[i][j] += min(grid[i-1][j], grid[i][j-1])
        
        return grid[-1][-1]
