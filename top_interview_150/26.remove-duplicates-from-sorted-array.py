#
# Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the
# duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The
# relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the
# number of unique elements in nums.
# 
# Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you
# need to do the following things:
# 
# 
# Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the
# unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The
# remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
# Return k.
# 
# 
# Custom Judge:
# 
# The judge will test your solution with the following code:
# 
# 
# int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
# int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length
# 
# int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation
# 
# assert k == expectedNums.length;
# for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
# ⁠   assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
# }
# 
# 
# If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [1,1,2]
# Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
# Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements
# of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
# It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are
# underscores).
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
# Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
# Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements
# of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
# It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are
# underscores).
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
# -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
# nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

#     def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
#         i = 0
#         j = 1

#             while j<n and nums[j]==cur:
#                 j += 1
#             if j<n:
#                 i += 1
#                 cur = nums[j]
#                 nums[i] = cur
#                 j += 1
#         return i+1

# No need to record the current value. Just compare the adjacent ones.
