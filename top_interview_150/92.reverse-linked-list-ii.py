#
# Given the head of a singly linked list and two integers left and right where
# left <= right, reverse the nodes of the list from position left to position
# right, and return the reversed list.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
# Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
# Output: [5]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the list is n.
# 1 <= n <= 500
# -500 <= Node.val <= 500
# 1 <= left <= right <= n
# 
# 
# 
# Follow up: Could you do it in one pass?
