# Testcase Example:  '[2,2,1]'
#
# Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except
# for one. Find that single one.
# 
# You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only
# constant extra space.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [2,2,1]
# Output: 1
# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
# Output: 4
# Example 3:
# Input: nums = [1]
# Output: 1
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
# -3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4
# Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears
# only once.
#
